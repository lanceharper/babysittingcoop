        <dt>Provider Points:</dt>
        <dd>
            A parent receives one point for every hour they watch someone else’s child. Thus,
            if I watched my friend’s 3 children for two hours, my friend would give me 6 points.</dd>
        <dt>Receiver Points:</dt>
        <dd>
            A parent gives one point for every hour their child is watched by someone else.
            Thus, if my 2 children were tended by my friend for 4 hours, I would give my friend
            8 points.</dd>
        <dt>Total Points:</dt>
        <dd>
            The sum of Provider Points and Receiver Points plus five points for participating.</dd>
